# Evolution of Log Anomaly Detection: A Comprehensive Overview

Log anomaly detection is a critical field in computer science that focuses on identifying unusual patterns or outliers in system logs, which can indicate system failures, security breaches, or performance issues. This document provides a detailed survey of the field’s evolution, from its inception in the early 2000s to the latest advancements as of 2023. It traces the development from early rule-based and statistical methods to modern deep learning and graph-based approaches, highlighting key milestones and referencing influential papers. This overview is intended for researchers, practitioners, and students seeking to understand the progression of log anomaly detection techniques.

## Early Beginnings: Rule-Based and Statistical Methods (2004–2015)
In the early 2000s, log anomaly detection relied heavily on rule-based systems and statistical methods due to the limitations of computational power and the lack of advanced machine learning frameworks. These early works laid the foundation for automated log analysis, addressing the challenge of processing large volumes of unstructured log data generated by complex systems.
